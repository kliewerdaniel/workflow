# Testing Strategy & Automation  

## 🔹 Testing Philosophy  
- Follow **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** for critical features.  
- Ensure all **business logic is covered** by tests.  
- Automate as much testing as possible to reduce human error.  

## 🔹 Types of Tests  

### 1️⃣ **Unit Tests**  
- Validate individual functions and methods.  
- Use **Pytest** for backend tests.  
- Use **Jest** or **React Testing Library** for frontend tests.  

**Example (Backend, Django + Pytest):**  
```python
def test_create_user(client):
    response = client.post("/api/users/", {"username": "testuser", "password": "securePass123"})
    assert response.status_code == 201
